** Polymorphism : It means object can have more than one form. It usually occur when Parent class object is used to refer child class.

For Eg. We have two classes. Parent class and Child class( which extends parent class).
--> Both classes have method "getName()". Child class @Override this method.

--> Create object of both the classes.

    Parent aParent = new Parent();
    Child aChild = new Child();

    aParent.getName();      //This is Parent
    aChild.getName();       //This is Child


--> Scenario 1 : Parent class object can refer to Child class object. Object always call the method of reference class.
                    i.e. new Child() -- Here, Child class is reference class of creating an object.

    Parent aParent2 = new Child();
    aParent2.getName();     //This is Child

    ** Parent class object which refer to child class call the child class method.

--> Scenario 2: Parent class object which refer to child class can not access child class methods.

Eg. If child class has a method name "getBirthday()" then Parent class object can not access Child class method.

    aParent2.getBirthday(); //Error : Object that refer to Child class can not access Child class methods.
