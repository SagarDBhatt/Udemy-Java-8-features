**** Try with Resources:

--> It published in JAVA 7.
--> Normally, certain method forced Dev to handle Exception which is called "Checked Exception". For Eg. FileNotFound Exception OR IOException.
        --> Ususally, Dev needs to surround the code with try and catch block.

--> Another variation of Try & catch block is "Try with Resources".
        --> Normally, when Dev create object of FileReader OR FileWriter, these object needs to close at the end of the operation. (Good Coding Practice)
        For Eg:
                FileReader fr = new FileReader(new File("Test.txt"));
                ------ Some code
                ------
                 fr.close();    //This is good coding practice to release the resource memory. If we do not then warning message appear as "Resource leak"

--> Advantage of using "Try with Resources" is, Dev does not need to close the object which created within try block.
        For Eg:

                try(FileReader fr = new FileReader(new File("Test.txt")) {

                ---------
                --------- some code     //Here, Dev does not need to close FileReader Resource. i.e. Eliminate "fr.close()".
                }
                catch(Exception e){
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
