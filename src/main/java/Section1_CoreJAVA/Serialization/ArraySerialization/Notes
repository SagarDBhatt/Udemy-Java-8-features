**** Serialize Array in Write and Read operation::

--> Create Array of class Person. Initializa the value of the objects. Dev created three objects in the array.

for eg:
Person[] aPerson = {new Person(1,"Sam",10), new Person(2, "Ram", 20), new Person(3, "Fam",30)};

--> Write Ops: Dev can write entire array of the objects into the file in one single statement.

For eg:
public void writeArray(Person[] personArray){

       try {
           FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("arrayOutput.txt"));
           ObjectOutputStream outputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(fos);

           for(Person p : personArray){
               outputStream.writeObject(p);
               System.out.println("Write operation for Array is successful!!!");
           }

           outputStream.close();
           fos.close();
       }

MIMP :: Here, Dev write single object at a time into the file. This is important as Searial Read can read a single object at a time.

--> In Read Operation, Dev needs to read a single object of class Person at a time.

For Eg:
public void readArray(){

        try {
            FileInputStream inputStream = new FileInputStream("arrayOutput.txt");
            ObjectInputStream objectInputStream = new ObjectInputStream(inputStream);
            System.out.println("Reading Object Successfully!!!");

            Person aPerson;
            while((aPerson = (Person) objectInputStream.readObject()) != null){
                System.out.println(aPerson);
            }

            inputStream.close();
            objectInputStream.close();
        }

MIMP : Here, Dev read a single object because "objectInputStream.readObject()" method can read a single object at a time.
