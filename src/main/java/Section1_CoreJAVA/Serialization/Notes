**** Serialization

--> Converting the object into Byte Stream is Serialization. [Deserialization is converting the byte stream into actual Java object]
--> The byte stream is platform independent. So the object serialized in one platform can be deserialized on a different platform.

For Eg:
--> Dev created a Person class with private property Id, Name and Age with Getter and Setter method.
--> Dev created a SerialWriteObject which has a method to convert Object of class "Person" into Byte Stream.

--> Serialization is simmilar to FileWriter.

        FileWriter                   Serialization
       1. FileWriter                1. FileOutputStream
       2. BufferedWriter            2. ObjectOutputStream
       3. FileWriter fw             3. FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(new File("xyz.txt"));
       = new FileWriter
       (new File("xyz.txt"))

    public void serialWrite(Person aPerson){

        try {
            FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(new File("SerialWriter.txt"));
            ObjectOutputStream objectOutputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(fout);

            objectOutputStream.writeObject(aPerson);

            objectOutputStream.close();
            fout.close();
        }
