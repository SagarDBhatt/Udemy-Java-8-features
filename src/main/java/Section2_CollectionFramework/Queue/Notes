==> Queue:

--> Interface in Java to process elements in FIFO order.
--> It is ordered list of objects. Limitation is insertion is limited at the end and deletion is limited at the begining, i.e. FIFO principle.

--> Queue is an interface and most common concrete classes that implements Queue interface are "PriorityQueue" & "LinkedList".
--> Both classes are not thread safe.
--> If thread safe opearation is required then "PriorityBlockingQueue" is implemented.

==> Since Queue is an interface, Objects can not be created for the type Queue. Dev needs a concrete class as mentioned above to create
    an object.

For Eg:
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        Queue<Integer> ue = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
        Queue<String> ts = new PriorityBlockingQueue<String>();

==========================================================================

==> Methods related with Queue:

1. add() : to add an element in object.

      Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<Integer>();

         for(int i=1;i<=8;i++)
            q.add(i);

2. To print elements either use advanced for loop OR just use object of the class

    for(Integer val : q){
            System.out.println("Queue value = " + val);
        }

        System.out.println("Elements of Queue = " + q);

O/P:
        Queue value = 1
        Queue value = 2
        Queue value = 3
        Queue value = 4
        Queue value = 5
        Queue value = 6
        Queue value = 7
        Queue value = 8
        Elements of Queue = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

--> Simillarly, remove(), size() and all the defaults method included in List Interface.
--> Note that remove() will remove the first element inserted in the queue i.e. head element.

==> Queue can be Unbounded (LinkedList) OR Bounded (ArrayLockingQueue).
==> BoundedQueue has fix size and no more elements can be added. whereas Unbouded queue does not have fix size
    and elements higher than the size can be added.
