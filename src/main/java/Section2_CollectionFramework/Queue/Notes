==> Queue:

--> Interface in Java to process elements in FIFO order.
--> It is ordered list of objects. Limitation is insertion is limited at the end and deletion is limited at the begining, i.e. FIFO principle.

--> Queue is an interface and most common concrete classes that implements Queue interface are "PriorityQueue" & "LinkedList".
--> Both classes are not thread safe.
--> If thread safe opearation is required then "PriorityBlockingQueue" is implemented.

==> Since Queue is an interface, Objects can not be created for the type Queue. Dev needs a concrete class as mentioned above to create
    an object.

For Eg:
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<Integer>();
        Queue<Integer> ue = new PriorityQueue<Integer>();
        Queue<String> ts = new PriorityBlockingQueue<String>();
