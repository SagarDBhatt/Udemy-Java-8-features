** Generics:
    --> Java Generics helps to re-use the same java code with different data types.
    for eg: Dev can create a common method to sort the values in array. Dev needs to pass datatype as an argument to define
    Arraytype - String, Integer, Double ect.








    --> Dev can use user defined class to pass as an parameter.
