** Generics:
    --> Java Generics helps to re-use the same java code with different data types.
    for eg: Dev can create a common method to sort the values in array. Dev needs to pass datatype as an argument to define
    Arraytype - String, Integer, Double ect.

    --> Create a method "ShowValue()" which takes Array type arguments and print the values.
     /**
         * This method is using Generics <T> to pass the datatype as an argument.
         * <T> : is used to mention that the method is using generics.
         * T[] t : This arguments shows that we need to provide Array datatype at the time of calling this method.
         * @param t
         * @param <T>
         */
        public <T> void showValues( T[] t) {
            for(T input : t){
                System.out.println("Values = "+ input);
            }
        }

     --> Dev needs to provide Array type argument when calling this method.
     --> Let's create two Array of type Integer and String.

            Integer[] intArray = {1,2,3,4,5};
            String[] strArray = {"a","b","c","d"};

     --> When Dev pass intArray method will show intArray elements.
                    //Dev provide Integer type array to call the method "showValue()"
                    object.showValues(intArray);

     --> Dev can use the same method and pass String Array to show String type elements.
                    object.strArray();


** Dev can use user defined class to pass as an parameter.


    /**
     * This Generic method is used to show object value based on the object passed in argument.
     * @param t
     * @param <T>
     */
    public <T> void showObject (T t){
        System.out.println("Object is = " + t.toString());
    }

    --> To call this method:

    // Passing object of class Generic object, class User and Class mentor to call the same method.
            object.showObject(new GenericsDemo());
            object.showObject(new user());
            object.showObject(new mentor());


    O/P::
        Object is = CodeSnippets.Generics.GenericsDemo@7b23ec81
        Object is = CodeSnippets.Generics.user@5f184fc6
        Object is = CodeSnippets.Generics.mentor@5b480cf9

** Object address: Whenever dev print the object, it prints object address (file structure -> Class -> Object address)

    --> Actually, when dev prints object, it calls toString() method.
    --> Each class in Java inherits / extends "Object" class by default. Object class has "toString()" method.
        So when Dev prints object, it calls the toString() method of "Object class (super)" and prints object address.

    --> Dev can Override the toString() method to provide any details at the time of printing object.

    For Eg: Dev generated and override toString() method for class GenericsDemo.
        [@Override annotation is required as toString() is Object class method which is Super class of all classes]

        @Override
            public String toString(){
                return "This is ToString() for class Generics Demo";
            }

     Now, if Dev calls "object.showObject(new GenericsDemo());" method then output would be
        "This is ToString() for class Generics Demo"
