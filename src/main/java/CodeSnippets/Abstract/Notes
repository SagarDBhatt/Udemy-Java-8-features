**** ABSTRACT Class

--> A class which has one or more abstract method is called Abstract class.
--> An abstract class can not be initiated i.e. Dev can not create an object of abstract class.
--> An abstract method is the method without any implementation.

--> Abstract class forces child class to implement all the abstract methods.
 [child class may or may not defined abstract methods. If Child class does not want to define abstract method
 then child class needs to declare as an Abstract class]

--> Abstract class and Interface have simillar concept of providing list of unimplemented methods. Any class that extends / implements
abstract class or interface has to define those unimplemented method.

--> By default, interface methods are public. Whereas methods in Abstract class can be public or protected
    (Not private as Private methods can not be overridden in child class).

--> Java does not support multiple inheritence. So a class can extends (inherits) a single class Whereas a class can implemets
    multiple interfaces.
